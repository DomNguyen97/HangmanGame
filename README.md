# HangMan
Hangman is a single player game where the player is given a limited number of guesses to a specific word with the only clues they have and blank spaces which represent the number of letters that specific word contains and a hint given by the game. Everytime the player makes a incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is added to the board. If the player guesses incorrectly too many times, the spaceman will be complete and the player loses.
